Mobile vs Desktop
 Mobile emails are easier to open but harder to link to a donation. Advancement office has a hypothesis that the prevalence of mobile emails has led to a decline in donation.


Merging Dataset 
* Change the name of mill_id to constituent_id so that we can merge the demographic data


How Many Emails Opened on Mobile vs. Desktop?
A cross tabulation of the variables “email_open” and “desktop” using the 5% sample of the summary dataset shows:  
* 72.3 % of emails went unopened. The 27.7% breaks out as: 
* 14.1% were opened only on mobile 
* 13.3% were opened only on desktop


How Many Donations Were Clicked in Mobile vs Desktop? 
A cross tabulation of variables “mobile” and “click” using the 5% sample of the summary dataset shows:
* 2.58% of all emails were “clicked”. Of those clicked:
   * 53.2% were on desktop
   * 45.7% were on mobile


We should look at this as a time series in order to understand any directional trends. Are we sending more mobile emails, and are they being opened at a greater (or lesser) rate?
